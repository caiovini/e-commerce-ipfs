# e-commerce-ipfs
E-commerce developed using ipfs and orbit db to stora user's data


This is a particular project using react, ipfs, orbit db, gun db and solidity. The idea is to develop a software completely descentralized where we can stabilish rules to sellers and buyers using smart contracts in the ehtereum network.

Also run the server on: https://github.com/caiovini/orbitdb-server
Run an instance of ipfs: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs using the command "ipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment"
