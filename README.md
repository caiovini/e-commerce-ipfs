Also run the server on: https://github.com/caiovini/orbitdb-server

The name eAgora stands for electronic agora. The definition of agora is given by Samuel Edward Konkin III as:


"The goal of agorism is the agora. The society of the open marketplace as near to untainted by theft, assault, and fraud as can be humanly attained is as close to a free society as can be achieved. And a free society is the only one in which each and every one of us can satisfy his or her subjective values without crushing others' values by violence and coercion."
